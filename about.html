      <h1>About Cresamor</h1>

      <section>
        <p>
          Cresamor came from being close to sports for a long time and noticing the same problems repeat, season after season. Film lived in one place, messages in another, schedules somewhere else entirely. Coaches were piecing systems together. Parents were trying to stay informed. Athletes were expected to grow, but rarely given clear ownership of their own progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea didn’t start with software. It started with frustration. With watching good athletes struggle to access their own film. With seeing communication break down over simple changes. With realizing that many of the tools meant to support development were built around systems, not people. Sports are already demanding. The technology around them shouldn’t make things harder.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cresamor began as an attempt to simplify what already existed. Not to reinvent sports technology, but to refine it. Film, communication, and scheduling are foundational needs. The goal was to bring them together in a way that felt clear, accessible, and respectful of everyone’s time. Especially the athlete’s.
        </p>

        <p>
          This platform is being built carefully, shaped by real use and real feedback. Every decision is guided by a simple question: does this help athletes better understand their work and stay connected to the people supporting them? If it doesn’t, it doesn’t belong.

        <h2>What the name means</h2>
        <p>
          The name Cresamor comes from the idea of growth driven by care. Development doesn’t happen through pressure alone. It happens when effort is seen, progress is understood, and support is consistent. Cresamor represents the space where structure and care meet, where athletes can grow with clarity instead of confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name is a reminder of why this exists in the first place. Not for noise. Not for trends. But for steady, meaningful growth.

        <h2>A Note from the Founder</h2>

        <p>
          Cresamor is personal to me. It’s built from years of observation, conversation, and lived experience around athletes and teams. I believe strongly in the power of sports to shape character, discipline, and confidence, and I believe the tools around sports should reflect that same integrity.
        </p>

        <p>
          This platform is still growing, just like the athletes it’s meant to serve. I’m committed to building it with intention, listening closely, and staying grounded in the realities of sport. Cresamor isn’t about replacing relationships or routines, it’s about supporting them in a way that feels honest and sustainable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for being here and for being part of the journey.
